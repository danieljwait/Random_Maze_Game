# Random Maze Game
A maze game that randomly generates mazes using Prim's algorithm in Python. The algorithm's implementation is on an adjacency matrix. The maze is modelled as a grid of squares, the vertices, with orthogonally adjacent squares connected, the edges. To add variety to the maze, the edges are chosen at random to add to the tree.

## Requirements
- A display at least 900x900 (the maze window is a fixed size)
- The Python packages listed in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt)

## Compatibility
The program has only been tested on the following:
- Python 3.9
- pygame 2.1.2
